ScrollSense is a Chrome extension that helps you build healthier social media habits through **AI-powered personalized interventions**. Unlike traditional blockers that frustrate users, ScrollSense uses **progressive friction** and **supportive nudges** to help you stay mindful while respecting your autonomy.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Mindful Session Intentions
Set your intention before browsing. Choose how long you want to spend (1, 2, or 5 minutes) and ScrollSense keeps you accountable.

### 🌫️ Progressive Blur
When you exceed your intended time, the screen gradually blurs—a gentle visual reminder without hard blocking. You're always in control.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Nudges
Personalized messages generated by AI based on your goals, preferences, and usage patterns. Messages are supportive and non-judgmental.

```
"Hey! 12 minutes on Instagram already - 'Finish thesis' is calling your name. You've totally got this! 🌟"
```

### 📊 AI Insights Dashboard
Weekly usage analytics with AI-generated insights about your patterns, trends, and personalized recommendations.

### 🔵 Blur Control
Full control over the blur effect with options to:
- Extend your session
- Remove blur temporarily (10 min)
- Disable for current session
- Disable for today

### ⏱️ Smart Timer
Floating timer on the right side shows elapsed time. Click to see detailed usage stats for current session and daily totals.

## 🎨 Human-Centered Design Principles

ScrollSense is built on research-backed design principles:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Progressive Friction** | Blur instead of blocking—users can always continue |
| **Non-Judgmental Tone** | Supportive messages, no shame or guilt |
| **User Autonomy** | Always in control—disable, skip, or extend anytime |
| **Context-Aware** | Different limits for different platforms |
| **Privacy-First** | All data stored locally on your device |
| **Adaptive** | Learns from your behavior, suggests realistic limits |
| **Transparency** | AI badge shows when messages are AI-generated |

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **Local Storage**: All data stays on your device
- ✅ **No Tracking**: We don't track your browsing content
- ✅ **Optional AI**: Works great without API key
- ✅ **Secure Keys**: API keys stored locally, never shared
- ✅ **Minimal Data**: Only time and goals sent for AI messages
