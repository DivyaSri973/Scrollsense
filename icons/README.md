# ScrollSense Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editor. The icon should represent ScrollSense's purpose of mindful social media usage.

Suggested design:
- Use a gradient background (purple/indigo to match the UI)
- Include a simple icon representing time management or mindfulness
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares as temporary icons until proper icons are designed.
